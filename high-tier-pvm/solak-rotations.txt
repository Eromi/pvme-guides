Solak - Optimal Rotations

Introduction
This section of the Solak guide aims to provide the current meta rotations and explain additional strategies for the smoothest kills possible for duo and 4 man kills. To give an idea of the kill speeds achievable with these strategies, below is a list of benchmarks to aim for:
P1 root skip
P1 1 cycle core
P2 SE erupt skip (killing both southern eruptions before being cleansed)
P2 climb skip (4 man only)
P2 2nd rain skip (duo only)
P3 2 pad 
P3 1 cycle elf (duo only)
P4 no realm
Notably, this guide will NOT cover rotations/tips for storm tanking P2. While storm tanking can speed up kills by as much as 10+ seconds, the risk involved is generally considered too high to be worth it for overall kills per hour. 

Pre-fight:
All members of the team should overload on Spirit weed, Lantadyme, and (optionally) Kwuarm incense sticks. When all team members are ready, they should overload at the bank. Once building adrenaline, all team members should DBA spec (or, preferably, EOF spec with a DBA amulet). 

P1 (duo):
You and your partner should mine the roots shown in the image below. Before starting, the base should use an ability such as Reprisal or Devotion to signal to the DPS that they are about to engage Solak. Both players should then use Berserk and proceed to do the following rotation:
Base: zerk > barge > cleave > deci > (limitless) (dw) bleed assault > freedom (2h auto) > cleave > deci > cane > sever (dive to pad) > cleave (stalling if necessary) (dive back to Solak) > (release stalled cleave by clicking Solak if necessary) deci
DPS: zerk > barge > cleave > deci > (limitless) bleed assault > cane > cleave > deci > mfury > backhand > cleave (stalling if necessary) (dive back to Solak) > (release stalled cleave by clicking Solak if necessary) deci
== end of zerk ==
Base: (tmw spear) dismember > slaughter + walk > tendril > deci > zgs spec > cleave > sever > deci > cane > cleave > (tmw spear) dismember > deci > assault > backhand > deci > (mage switch) auto sonic > voke + combust > auto shard > sun
DPS: zgs spec > sever > deci > freedom (2h auto) > cane > cleave > mfury > backhand (voke) > assault > cleave > (tmw spear) slaughter + walk > tendril > deci > cleave > (dw) sever) > (mage switch)  auto sonic > corrupt > auto shard > sun
